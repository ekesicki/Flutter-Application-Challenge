You should be able to drag and drop the following files: 'assets' and 'lib.'
As far as pubspec.yaml use it as a reference as to where to apply following lines of code:
assets:
    - assets/metadata/
    # TODO: after getting real data delete the following dummy data
    - assets/dummy_json_requests/
    - assets/dummy_metadata/
    - assets/images/
